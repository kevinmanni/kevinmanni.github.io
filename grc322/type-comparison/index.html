        <h1>Neue Haas Grotesk vs. Helvetica Neue </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Neue Haas Grotesk</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>“Neue,” the German word for new, reflects the goal of Neue Haas Grotesk, translated to New Haas San-Serif. This sans-serif typeface that was created in 1957 by Swiss type designers, Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann. The duo worked at the Hass Type Foundry in Basel, Switzerland and decided to work together to create a new typeface after noticing a decline in typeface sales. They based their new typeface from old grotesque typefaces, such as Akzindenz-Grotesk, Französische Grotesk, and Französische Grotesk, Neue Hass Grotesk was created. It was designed with the goal of creating a clean, clear, and highly readable typeface, grounding itself in the principles of Swiss modern design. Its clean structure rejected ornament in favor of functional communication, aligning typography with the rational, grid-based systems of the International Typographic Style. Also known as the Swiss style, a graphic design movement that emerged in Switzerland and Germany in the 1950s, and introduced the Grid System, where mathematical grids are used to provide an orderly, structured, and consistent layout. After some time, the name was changed to Helvetica to be more marketable. Then later in 2010, Christian Schwartz digitalized the typeface making it widely available for designers around the world to use. </p>
             
			 <h3>Helvetica Neue</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Helvetica Neue was created as a reworking of Neue Haas Grotesk to unify the structure, weights, and widths. It was released in 1983 and designed by the Stemple Type Foundry in Germany. Specific changes in the font included constant cap heights, widening crossbars on lowercase, widening strokes, rounded characters have softer curves, and punctuation changed to be better balanced. The family was expanded to 51 versions with 8 different weights, obliques for the expanded versions, nine weights plus obliques for the condensed, as well as a bold outline version for the regular width. Helvetica’s neutral appearance allowed it to function across advertising, corporate identity, signage, and public systems, making it one of the most widely used fonts in history. Its widespread adoption helped define the visual language of late twentieth-century modernism and corporate communication.</p>
